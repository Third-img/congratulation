              Congratulations on your 'pinning'! You have reached another
              milestone and as alwaysâ€” I'm very proud of you. You have been
              working hard to get to where you are right now and we haven't
              failed to see it. You were strong, you had the wit but you kept
              quiet out of care. Despite of all the problems, all you have
              poured on to our cups were love, care, and patience. We won't ever
              know why you're hated, but I will say that you are more loved than
              hated. More loved by me and other people around you who you've
              given love to. I assure you that even on the toughest battles
              you'll never be alone, and I'll also be there when it's time for
              you celebrate. I love you! I always have.
